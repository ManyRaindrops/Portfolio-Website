        <h2>Aspiring Programmer</h2>
        <p>It didn't come quickly to me, but I came to love it more and more in time. Like most people my age, I interfaced with technology through a screen that only wanted my attention. I didn't see it as a tool or a gift but a resource to be exploited to my own childish pleasures. When I grew older, I realized it was a powerful vessel and leveraging arm that could help me realize the goals that had slowly been growing with me. It was no longer took from me, but could give as I commanded.</p>

    <section id="polyglot">
        <h2>Aspiring Polyglot</h2>
        <p>At first I had point of reference for language. Then I slowly realized how deaf I felt in the presence of those communicating in another language. In time I began to realize that there was more to language than just being able to listen and understand what another person was saying, but also to be able to peer into their heart. But what I was really looking for then and now was the voice of a person whose words held the weight of meaning.

    <section id="person">
        <h2>Aspiring Person</h2>
        <p>I am an "Aspiring Person," but I am not incomplete. What is a person? What is a human? The first distinction is life. The second is rationality. So answer me this, What is the good life? While I will not provide my response here, I will list some of my life goals: being faithful to my baptismal promises, raising a family of joy and peace, and to always "live of Love." Then the question really only is, "What is the good?"
