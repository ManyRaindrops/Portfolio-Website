        <h2>Aspiring Programmer</h2>
        <p>It didn't come quickly to me, but I came to love it more and more in time. I am currently learning Python in university, but I am also learning other languages for Web-Development and working with LLMs. I am opening to studying cybersecurity as the focus for my degree, but the choice is currently open for me. Programming is a puzzle of systems and security, and my work will be in both.</p>

    <section id="polyglot">
        <h2>Aspiring Polyglot</h2>
        <p>At first I had point of reference for language. I didn't understand the value of knowing another language besides my mother tongue because english simply dominated all of my communication. However, as I met more people, I realized that I wanted to be able to communicate with them in the language that they were most comfortable with and also be able to draw from the well of the writings and songs made in those languages.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="person">
        <h2>Aspiring Person</h2>
        <p>I am an "Aspiring Person," but I am not incomplete. What is a person? What is a human? The first distinction is life. The second is rationality. So answer me this, What is the good life? While I will not provide my response here, I will list some of my life goals: being faithful to my baptismal promises, raising a family of joy and peace, and to always "live of Love." Then the question really only is, "What is the good?"
