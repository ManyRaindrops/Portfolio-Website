            <h1><strong>Open Source Business</strong></h1>
            <h2>The pitfalls and proven solutions for open source businesses.</h2>
            <p>Some developers want to create projects that are fully transparent to the public, open for all to see and spread. However, many of these projects fails to take off or struggle to maintain their presence due to the lack of financial support from the community. In theory, if their product is good, people will donate; but--more often than not--these projects sink due to a lack of donations.</p>
            <section id="donations">
                <h2><em>The Problem: Donations</em></h2>
                <p>"The economic models work because we have an ideal view of humans," said (finding reference name). This principle is directly applicable to the common views of open source, which often idealize the developer-community relationship. Some hope that, in create a free and execellent product, they will be able to gather to themselves excellent donations.</p>
                <p>While this has been the case with various projects that may on accoation receive a fairly hefty grant from corporations such as Google or Proton, they are an exception. It seems that the commmon case is the sight of a developer treading water, barely able to keep from sinking below the waters of financial debt. What actually happens is that most people don't donate: "someone else can donate." For example, while it is stated that only 2 percent of Blender users donate, only about 8000 of over an estimated 20 million users donate.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="cloud-computing">
                <h2>The Solution: The Cloud</h2>
                <p>What many have turned to as the solution to this issue is quite effective and widespread issue are cloud services. Whether it be cloud computing or storage, the key is to have something like that in the first place. If a company cannot pay for the service of creating a software that runs on the clients' computers (by virtue of its licensing on it) they must create a way for people to pay for things run on the developer's hardware. Companies such as Proton, Bitwarden, Portmaster, and Ghost are examples of organizations that have leveraged this model to the fullest extent by providing server-first open-source products.</p>
                <p>Without something to pay for, customers default to the group-think ideal of "someone else will pay for it." If they are getting something for free, the likely hood that they will pay (as it seems) diminishes significantly due to the fact that there is no perceived immediate value in donating to a project when the main and whole of the work is accessible immediately for free, now. What the cloud-first model does is provide open source projects a way to fund themselves without breaking from their open-source promises. Users may want open-source, but developers need to create a viable business solution if they want their product to be such.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="ideal-model">
                <h2>The Ideal FOSS Model</h2>
                <p>Portmaster, it seems, has mastered the ideal model of a product line that consists of both client-side locally hosted software and cloud-computing. Their first product, Portmaster, is a local-first firewall which is supported by their complementary VPN service: SPN. For Blender, a company so integral to the digital art community yet also so loosely held up by a miniscule few may be able to benefit from such a model. Perhaps by integrating a user-interface chatbot that helps users (especially new users) find the tools that they need on the app, directly in the interface or a online version of the app which can only be accessed with a premium membership. Other ideas include cloud storage and AI generation features, but both may prove to be difficult either due to fiercely storng competition or fiercely storng community disapproval. One way or the other, organizations and projects such as Blender need to find an adequete business model to support their ventures, or they will sink link so many before them.</p>
