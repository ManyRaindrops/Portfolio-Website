            <h1><strong>LEARNING ABOUT LEARNING</strong></h1>
            <h2>"Knowledge is power" and wisdom thrives, but both are only acquired by learning.</h2>
            <p>A developer is always learning, and we are always involved with systems of some kind. It is only natural then to investigate the means by which we acquire knowledge and wisdom in our practice and in general. The following is derived from what I have learned, heard of, and applied in my own practice over the years.</p>
            <section id="overview">
                <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
                <p>Learning consists of utilizing one's <strong>mind</strong> according to a certain <strong>method</strong> in order to fulfill a <strong>motivation</strong>, such as being able to speak fluently in a foreign language.</p>
                <p>Learning requires neuroplasticity, intelligence, memory, comprehensible inputs, active recall, and spaced repetition. For the person learning, it is necessary that they also have goals, and intention behind their effort.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Neuroplasticity: your mind needs to be able to adapt, to get and store information in the the neurons of your brain. If you cannot adapt, you cannot learn. Without learning, we are stagnant.</li>
                    <li>Intelligence: you need to be able to wrap your head around concepts and visualize them, to behold them in your mind. If you cannot understand, you will know things but not how they relate to anything.</li>
                    <li>Memory: your ability to recall information is the only way that your learning will have been for something, do not forget. Without memory, we are lost. Nurture your ability to remember and make it useful.</li>
                    <li>Comprehensible Input: when you are learning, you need things that are simple enough for you to digest and work with, but not so hard that you can't even understand what's going on.</li>
                    <li>Active Recall: you now need to try to replicate the comprehensible inputs. You are now trying to make comprehensible outputs. This can be writing a story or trying to have a conversation in a foreign language.</li>
                    <li>Spaced Repetition: there is not point in beating the bush by testing yourself over and over again on the exact same material. You need to grow and test yourself periodically until you have reached mastery.</li>
                    <li>Goals: know why you are doing what you are doing. Learning can be hard! Don't give up because you don't know why you are even trying to learn something. Know what you want before you start.</li>
                </ol>

            <section id="the-mind">
                <h2>The Mind</h2>
                <p>The mind is the center of the learning process. It controls the various powers of the human body and has in itself power of intellection. However, in order to harness the learning capacity of the mind, one needs to have a solid foundation. This is why, after learning one language, it is possible to learn another in a relatively short amount of time since your native tongue acts as a foundation for your next language.</p>
                <p>The mind is like a muscle, whose quality is determined by the amount of changing that can occur and the ability for that change to be retained. However, our ability to learn is also tied to about ability to accurately imprint in our minds the forms that we observe and take in with our senses.</p>
                <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
                <p>The neuroplasticity of our brains is the primary ability by which we are able to acquire information. The younger a person is, the most neuroplasticity they have in their brain. However, although the youngest of us often have the most of it, they also have the smallest foundation and the least amount of discipline. Try teaching a baby a language, and then try teaching a highschooler that same language; development is not purely a matter of neuroplasticity, but is significantly impacted by it.</p>
                <p>While all of the principles of learning still apply to each stage, it must be most clearly recognized that the hardest period will be the beginning wherein all foundational skills must be established. These skills include discipline and focus. Hence, the early development stage will often contain a severe lack of discipline and focus, both of which are necessary for further development.</p>
                <h3>Intelligence</h3>
                <p>To have a brain that can adapt quickly if it adapts like sludge. Intelligence is the ability to precisely imprint concepts and ideas into the very matter of our minds. To have a high intelligence is a culmination of various abilities, but the primary ability is that which is most essential: the attainment of forms.</p>
                <p>While intelligence may increase over time during the developmental period of a person, what remains over time, and what usually does not change significantly in adulthood, is the person's crystal intelligence. This intelligence, regardless of its whatever ability, must always be accompanied by hard work and dedication.</p>
                <h3>Memory</h3>
                <p>And what is the ability to change if nothing is valuable is retained, an epiphany for the cure for cancer is no cure at all if the knowledge of it passes just as fast as it came. To have no memory is well documented, it is called amnesia. And it is horrifying. Therefore, for santiy and strength, learn to wield and cherish your memory.</p>
                <p>The key of memory is not only long term memory, but working memory. To be able to retain information in short periods of times. Through the efforts of holding up those ideas in working memory, the information can be stored into the dark cracks and crevices of your mind. There can be no new long-term memory without a working working-memory.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="the-method">
                <h2>The Method</h2>
                <p>The mind is a system with finite capacity both in storage and input. It gets to make the most out of what is available. This means that learning should follow these principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Comprehensible Inputs</li>
                    <li>Active Recall (Outputs)</li>
                    <li>Spaced Repetition (of 2)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The mind is also a system with access to various powers, powers that have certain limits and breaking points. The utilization of which requires key elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Multi-modal Inputs</li>
                    <li>Just-Challenging-Enough Outputs</li>
                    <li>Interleaving Study vs. Single-Subject Focus</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The mind exists within a system of sensation. We have passions, attention spans, and strengths/weaknesses. Thus, these are principles of applying the learning principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stable Input</li>
                    <li>Focused Outputs</li>
                    <li>Purpose Directed</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Comprehensible Inputs</h3>
                <p>As taught by language immesion programs, in schools and in military programs, the key to learning revolves around the "natural method." Which is essentially the child's way of learning: bits and pieces over times, in context, and with clear aids. For example, a language learner would fail to learn Greek by reading Aristotle, but could build up to that point of intense complexity by studying sentences related to each other with novel words and translations as the "aid." For a child, that aid would be the physical world and their parents guiding them by hand.</p>
                <h3>Active Recall (Outputs)</h3>
                <p>Each person has to their command various powers, powers of intellect and movement, powers of will and speech. All powers related to a certain subject can be used to develop it. In language learning, this listening, reading, writing, and finally speaking. In conceptualization, it is memorizing the points and connections, explaining and diluting, and applying or transforming the concept at hand. By testing one's ability, the ability can grow like a muscle. It is said that the "mind is a muscle that needs to be trained," and without struggle there is no gain: "No pain, no gain."</p>
                <h3>Spaced Repetition (of 2)</h3>
                <p>And like a muscle, it is useless to overwork the mind by "beating the bush" or "throwing spagetti and meatballs at the wall until something sticks." Spaced repetition is intentional, precise, and calculated. The number of repetitions needed decreases exponentially over time until a maintance level is reached wherein further time gaps would only result in loses. As the memory seeps into long-term storage, more time is needed to train the mind and ensure the development of myelin sheets that cover the neurons. Myelin sheets are to neurons what muscles are to bones. Bones are useless without muscles, so to are neurons without myelin; and them ore of it, the better.</p>
                <h3>Multi-modal Inputs</h3>
                <p>Just as there are various ways to train the mind, there are also various ways to receive information. truly, the best form of information to use to learn is the one that distracts us the least. The mind is a warehouse of various powers, and although some might believe they are attuned to a certain input-type, they are only less distracted and more focused with those learning types. Some people fall asleep on books while others learn for hours with lectures. What matters is focus, not the input type. In fact, in most cases, a combination of all input types is the best, since different modes have different purposes. For example, audio and visuals specialize in what written words finds difficult to describe.</p>
                <h3>Just-Challenging-Enough Outputs</h3>
                <p>And just as the challenge of learning may feel wonderful, though challenging, one must realize that is only feels good when progress is made. By over-reaching, one fails to learn effectively and may lengthen the time needed to aquire that information or skill. The concept of "S.M.A.R.T. Goals" can be applied in this situation, just as the common saying, "Don't overwork yourself." It is true that if there is "no pain," there is "no gain," but there is also significant loses with working beyond one's means. We all have certain powers, and growing is taking those powers just to the limit, not far beyond.</p>
                <h3>Interleaving Study vs. Single-Subject Focus</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, when one the effort for the practice of one skill or study has been exhausted for a time or a moment, it may be beneficial to move on to another. For example, after studying math, one can go to study history or biology, then another subject or math again. This principle is similar to that of "super-sets" in fitness exercise routines wherein the athelete works out one set of muscles and then another set while letting the first one rest. However, in the cases of seeking to enter a "flow-state," interleaving is not a good solution.</p>
                <h3>Stable Input</h3>
                <p>Inputs should be consistent and expected on a generic level. Inputs should only consist of the learning material, and not other unrelated materials such as loud noises, strange smells, pain or soreness, eye-strain, or other attention attracting inputs such as one's phone, the other parts of one's computer, the envy or interest in another person or event, or even the simple thoughts that flutter around in one's head. The input should be stable and solely from the target material: remove distractios, move to an input-free zone, mandate consistency.</p>
                <h3>Focused Outputs</h3>
                <p>When an output is being created, there should be a clear goal in mind: "I want to explain Moore's law," "I want to do backflip." There should be steps that bring a person to that point. Essentially, everything taht is in a SMART Goal: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. It is included in that understanding that the person is utilizing the "Methods" listed out here.</p>
                <h3>Purpose Directed</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the most insidious question is: "Why." There are few questions that ache the mind so horribly than that question, if it is left unanswered. Know why you want to learn what you are trying to learn. Do not float aimlessly, unless that is what you are trying to learn.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="the-motivation">
                <h3>The Motivation</h3>
                <p>The root of discipline is reason. And the expression of reason is motivation. While there are some things to be said of long and short-term motivation, the key is ultimatley in the reason. So ask, "Why? Why am I doing this? Why am I here?" To what end? For what purpose? Of what longing? Ask, why enough, and you will find a reason of which there is nothing before it. It is your answer to the quesiton: "What is the good life?"</p>
                <h3>Delayed Gratification</h3>
                <p>The biggest business is instant gratification: "Buy now," "Pay later," and all the tools that facilitate that. Of them, social media stands at the top, it's machines are in your pockets and it's product is your profile. The only cost is your "enjoyment and connection with the internet community." The strain of learning is waiting for results. Some skills take years to master. Some knowledge takes immense studying to understand. Some things are simply hard to get to. Recognzie the end, and embrace it with the present.</p>
                <h3>Instant Gratification</h3>
                <p>Gamification is the key method of gaining short term attention. It is the worm that lures the fish in, the carrot, not the stick. But it is not a lasting good and cannot be held as the ultimate key to your learning. There is always something out there with a greater momentary high. Rather, enjoy it as one does with fireworks, marveling at the beauty of it all, and letting it go. Not forgetting it, like we do with all the videos we scroll through, but as givng rest to our minds that our destination is greater. it cannot be held on as the final product.</p>
                <h3>Seeking the Challenge</h3>
                <p>Here is a quote, whose origin I do not know, to end this section and post off: "To want something only because there is no other way out, is the way a slave acts. To want it because it is no trouble (following likes or impulses) is the way an animal acts. to want it in spite of the bother (guided by reason or duty) is the way a rational human acts. To want even the bother of it (with your eyes on the ideal or on God) is the way a hero or a saint acts.</p>
