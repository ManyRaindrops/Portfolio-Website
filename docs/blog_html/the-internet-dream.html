            <h1><strong>The Internet Dream</strong></h1>
            <h2>A place for exeryone...or just the bots?</h2>
            <p>It is not esoteric or unpopular knowledge to know that the internet is full of slop. Whether it is websites stuffed full of generic SEO query terms, AI generated articles, or just the mind-rotting degeneracy of "the other half," there is by no means a shortage of free expression on the internet. Yet, at the same time, some are worried that they won't have that power of free expression in this safe haven anymore, and many are facing governmental crackdowns on this said online.</p>
            <section id="bots">
                <h2><em>What is a "bot"?</em></h2>
                <p>Obviously, the first reference would be to literal bots: webscrapers, Ai generators, and everything in between. However, there is a more generic sense of the name "bot," that may in certain circumstances be used as a derogatory label against people who seemingly perfectly conform to "the system" and act without question according to the mandates of their authorities. In a world in which governments feel the threat of social unrest through the internet and thus are seeking to quell the fires of the people by directly monotoring online presences for certain behavioral patterns, being "free online" seems to be a thing of the past.</p>
                <p>Gone are the days of "anything said goes" are here are the hours of surveilance, enforcement, and boundaries. While it is true that the open web faces such restrictions, the dark and deep web have always faced this conflict as the line there is most clearly beyond what is acceptable in many cases. At least, that is what is most frequently spoken of on the news. What occurs now is less of a shift in policy than a deliberate and intentional realization that the government position of moral neutrality is unteneble. Governments must take a side, and they choose themselves. And they do, as their citizens do or as organizations and companies would, they are not unique in that regard.</p>

            <section id="what-may-be">
                <h2>What May Be</h2>
                <p>If you have ever read Fahrenheit 451 or 1984 then you know the literary perception of the surveliance state, one of compliance and order. But you must also see the mundane. You must see Machiavelli's work, The Prince, understand the "banality of evil," and recognize that most change comes in steps rather than leaps. If one wishes to be on a side that doesn't just revert back to the chaos of the early web or into the madness of total surveliance, one needs first to recognize what is wrong with either side.</p>
                <p>While many would like to imagine Hell as a place of joy for demons, it is actually a fire for them and the sinners they drag there. Such is the way of destruction, wherein both the accused and accuser are both sent away on a path that at first seemed like a joy for someone, at least. So too the same is with how the spread of control or freedom appears. It <em>looks</em> like peace, like joy. But it is not. It is manufactured to appeal to your better sensibilities, but hidden away in its depths is the seed for something more than just roses and rainbows.</p>

            <section id="the-question">
                <h2>The Question</h2>
                <p>At the heart of this issue is not governmental policy or the liberty of the internet or even "free speech," but values. More specifically, <em>moral values</em>. Regardless of your view of morality, whether it really is a thing or not, the point of concern is the existence of values and how people apply them. Perhaps it can be said that while many people value many things, they only choose to invest in a few, and of those they only succeed in manifesting a small percentage. Thus, when an ardent and powerful entity or figure arises, it is easy to see the hope of one's own change in them, and that spokesperson or government as an ideal instrument of change.</p>
                <p>What is forgotten is that that that person or power has values of its own, values that might not align with your own. It is what is hidden in statements masked as the truth that make lies powerful, that which is hidden in softened speech, and crafty remarks. The truth will always be here just as existence must be before holes and corruptions can exist. Whether one wants anarchy or structured leadership is a question of what one values, and the reasons they have to hold onto those values. If those entities or figures truly have the power to shape society and even the world, then it is of utmost concern to examine their directives and see if it really aligns with what is desired, needed, and right.</p>
