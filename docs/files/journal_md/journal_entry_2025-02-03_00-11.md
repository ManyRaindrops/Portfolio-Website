## Thoughts:
Writing CSS has been a very difficult part of this project. After learning the basics, I started work on making my site. 

## Reflections:
Since I am still new to this, and unfamiliar with the language, I often used AI to point me to the styles that I was looking for. Without that, I would have had to search through many forums. The danger of course, is that I only use AI. However, as I have already known, that is simply not an option because AI lacks the ability to see the bigger picture. Thus, I will still completely involved in every link of code. However, since I simply do not know any javascript at this time, but also needing it to be able to test if my site is working as I intended, I did use AI to generate code for buttons, which i have found to be a very simple process. However, I also created a custon drop down menu. That took a very long time, and I now see the very strong appeal of using content libraries. Taking the advice I was given, I decided to not use a content library from the get go. I am not sure if I will for this project.
