# Journal Entry: The close of 2 weeks

## Thoughts:
After working on this website for almost two weeks, I can safetly say that I have acheived most of the goals that I initially set out with when I first started this project. The main failure I had was that I ran out of time to go over javascript in depth. The project for learning JavaScript will include the search and filter functionality that I will be implementing in the coming week. However, due to my school schedule, that time may have to be extended, depending on how fast I can add final touches to the other sections. Furthermore, with the Sunstone Innovation Challenge just getting started, I will be pivoting more time towards that until further notice. And if we win, that will be my main project! However, as my team and I infer, we have a slim chance of winning on account of our lack of experience and senority. Nevertheless, the challenge will be a good opporunity to learn and innovate.
## Reflections:
If I could start over again, I would have attempted to create a more clear road map.
