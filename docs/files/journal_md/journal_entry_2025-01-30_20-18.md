## Thoughts:
With the help of AI, I created a file to help me quickly translate my markdown files into HTML ones to automate that process as I work on studying JavaScript.

## Reflections:
AI is very useful in this field, but it has limitations of perspective and understanding. However, due to my limited understanding of HTML, AI was very useful in raising the information I needed to know about to be able to make the program. Previously I had also created journal_entries.py and note_generator.py with a similar perspective in mind. Right now I am not focused on Python, but on web development yet I also need automation to make my workflow faster. Hence, Python came in as a useful tool and thereby AI as well.
