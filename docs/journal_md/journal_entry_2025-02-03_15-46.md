# Journal Entry: Cross-compatability

## Thoughts:
As I am learning how to implement the various features, I am finding the issue of cross-compatibility to be rather significant. I will see just how much I am able to fix these issues in the coming day.

## Reflections:
This is posing a significant issue. Hence, as a first test, I will be making sure that the website works on major browsers. I will also need to figure out a way to test the site on iPhones as I do not have one.
