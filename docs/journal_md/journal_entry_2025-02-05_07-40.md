# Journal Entry: Commit messages

## Thoughts:
Now that I have become more thorougly aware of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, I have turned attention to my commit messages. Looking back, they are horrendous and I shall proceed to write better commit messages.
## Reflections:
Commit messages help indicate what changes have been made. Although my messages were often descriptive, they were not always useful or necessary. For example, a significant number of my early commits were made with the sole purpose of trying to view what the output information would look like. This was before I realized I could test the files locally first.
