## Thoughts:
After implementing some of the patterns from https://web.dev/css#dive-into-css-patterns and getting to see CSS working, I will now be moving on to https://web.dev/learn/css and eventually utilize https://ui.shadcn.com/docs in my project.

## Reflections:
While these libraries are useful, they are also temptingly simple to implement. However, as I do not plan to reach professional web-developer levels, in which I could be the one making those resources, this situation is suitable for me as I can use the resources as a means to familiarize myself with CSS and also create an at least half-descent website.
