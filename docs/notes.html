    <section id="meta-learning">
        <h2>Meta-learning</h2>
        <p>Meta-learning is learning about learning. For people, it is about crafting the best methods for the efficiency and efficacy of acquiring knowledge or skills. In computer science, it is a subfield of machine learning that is about making algorithms better able to learn and predict from their data sets.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="programming">
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>Programming is writing computer executable instructions. It's power is not as much in the type of language, just as there are many languages in the world, but the power of computers, just as many words communicate the same meaning. When the power of CPUs, GPUs, and memory units are harnessed, the world becomes one's oyseter.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="natural-language">
        <h2>Natural Language</h2>
        <p>Natural language is human language. For people, it is a tool, a culture, and a an art. For computers, it is the gateway to grasping the real world. My interest lies both in learning about various languages and seeking to become fluent in a few, or at least two, and also in its applications with machine learning and AI. There are many uses for NLP technology in chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis. All of which are yet to be wholistically unified in a single system.</p>
