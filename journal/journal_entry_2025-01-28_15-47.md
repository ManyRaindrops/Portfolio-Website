## Thoughts:
From this point, I will begin to learn (CSS, HTML, and JavaScript) and program the rest of my website to the best of my ability. From this point forward, I will only be using AI to ask questions regarding how to code in CSS, HTML and JavaScript and not to generate any code. All of the code that exists on this porject going forward will be my own unless specifically marked otherwise.

## Reflections:
I have a lot to learn.
