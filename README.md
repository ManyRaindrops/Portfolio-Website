# Portfolio Website
This project is a simple portfolio website for showcasing personal work and projects. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All documentation of the process of learning how to build this website has been recorded.

## Project Goals
1. Become familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github, Git, Github pages, VS Code, and using AI as a tool rather than a human-replacement.
2. Create a personal website, which I can use to help me create other sites that I may wish to make in the future.
3. Demonstrate my ability to learn quickly (start: 1/28/2025 ; end: 2/5/2025 ; irregular work schedule due to school)

## Goals Acheived
1. Gained familiarity with beginner HTML and CSS coding practices, utilized core features on Github (Issues, Pull Requests, and Github Pages) and Git (commits, staging, branches, merging, revert), programmed the entire site in VS Code, and learned to prompt LLMs for the purposes listed below.
2. I have created the primary elements of the site, and will continue to add content, update the site, and fix issues.
3. Granted that I am the sole evaluator of my experience doing this, I believe that I have demonstrated that I can learn quickly and apply the best of what I have learned. That skill, more than ever, is neccessary when working with AI, which was an essential learning tool in this project. Using AI is like following a tutorial, except you don't know if the tutor is always right. It is best used for searching basic elements that I, the person, can use to compile into a larger and more complex system.

In this project, by 2/5/2025, I did not get to delve deeply into JavaScript.

## Current Goals
1. Main goals are complete, except learning JavaScript: -> Complete reviewing web-dev resources on JavaScript as well as the CSS and HTML tracks (which I only complete the most pertinent sections)
2. Continue to add content for the Portfolio

## Resources Used
- https://web.dev/learn
- Leading LLMs (free plan): GPT 4o, Gemini, and DeepSeek
- Copilot feature (free plan)

## LLM Usage
1. Explaning new/hard concepts: very useful for quickly getting a response rather than having to search through general coding websites.
2. Writing helpful comments: especially useful for the learning process, when not all points are in memory or fully understood. Comments by AI are labeled: "AI-made"
3. Repetitive tasks: using AI to replicate features of index.html to the other pages, auto generate skeleton HTML elements for testing (such as article sections)
4. Generating Python scipts: used for automating and templating of journal and note entries; the focus of this project is on webdevelopment
5. Writing temporary example code: helpful in the learning process to see relevant examples. Such AI generated code was removed or indicated as such

# File Explanations
1. The primary pages (index.html, projects.html, etc.) and secondary pages (in folders journal_html, notes_html, etc.) contain all of the visible content that the user interacts with. main.js, styles.css, and all the images are in their respsective folders.
2. The "files" folder contains the original markdown used to create notes and journal entries. It is translated to HTML with the python scripts in the Python folder. The Python was created for purpose of automation and creating template documents.
