# Portfolio Website

This project is a simple portfolio website for showcasing personal work and projects. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All documentation of the process of learning how to build this website has been recorded.

Goals of this project:
1. Become familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, related libraries/frameworks (Bulma and Bootstrap), Github, Git, Github pages, VS Code, and using AI as a tool rather than a human-replacement.
2. Create a personal website, which I can use to help me create other sites that I may wish to make in the future.
3. Demonstrate my ability to learn quickly (start: 1/28/2025 ; end: 2/2/2025 ; irregular work schedule due to school)

The use of AI in this project:
1. Explaning new/hard concepts: very useful for quickly getting a response rather than having to search through general coding websites.
2. Writing helpful comments: especially useful for the learning process, when not all points are in memory or fully understood. Comments by AI are labeled: "AI-made"
2. Repetitive tasks: using AI to replicate features of index.html to the other pages, auto generate skeleton HTML elements (such as article sections)
3. Generating Python scipts: used for automating and templating of journal and note entries; the focus of this project is on webdevelopment
4. Writing temporary example code: helpful in the learning process to see relevant examples. Such AI generated code was removed or indicated as such
